## What is CRM?

 CRMs are a tool that almost every sales team uses to track prospective and existing customers through the sales process.
 
 CRMs should allow us to:
 
 - Track Leads (people whose contact info we have gathered but who may or may not be interested in our product).
 
 - Convert Leads into Opportunities (leads are converted into opportunities when they show interest in buying the product).
 
  - Associate an Opportunity with an Account.
    
  - Associate Contacts with an Opportunity.
